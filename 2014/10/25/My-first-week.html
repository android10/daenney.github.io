<p>I expected to write a post much earlier than this but the first week was so busy all I wanted to do in the evenings was get home and relax, screw the computer.</p>

<p>Monday was my first day and it was fun. I got thrown in at the deep end helping to form the squad I&#8217;m going to be a member of. Since I&#8217;d only been at the company 2.5hrs there was a lot to take in and do all of the sudden. The great thing about it though is that I helped form the team I&#8217;m going to be on and that I&#8217;ve been with it from the beginning. By the end of the week I was making my first code contributions to the Puppet code base.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course there was also some official business needing to take place like register with the necessary authorities and start my search for a home of my own.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today was my first day off which was spent relaxing, looking at houses, getting a tour through Stockholm and eventually dinner and hanging out at a bar. It was great.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even though it was a pretty grey and rainy day this city is just beautiful. Walking over the bridges and looking out over the lake, especially at night when the lights turn on, is breathtaking. I can only imagine how nice that same walk will be during spring and summer. The city seems to embrace you, like everything and everyone belongs somehow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whenever I&#8217;m in a new city I feel a bit uneasy at first, especially out at night on the streets because you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;ll run into. I have a knack for walking into those exact parts of any town you should not be in alone at night, as a tourist. I&#8217;m sure this city has its spots but so far I haven&#8217;t found them, even though I&#8217;ve gotten lost plenty of times. As I was walking home tonight from the bar it struck me how safe the streets feel, even those little alleys you know to normally avoid.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was a great first week and I&#8217;m curious to see what the second week has in store for me. But, first things first, I&#8217;m going to enjoy my Sunday.</p>
