<p>Over the years I&#8217;ve tried to use PGP multiple times. However, I&#8217;ve always failed miserably at managing keys and understanding the lifecycle involved. This is evident by searching the keyservers for my name, it&#8217;ll turn up a few rather idiotic and dubiously keys. None of them should be used except for one, <a href="https://daenney.github.io/gpg/">0x18D40820FA0EE03C</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These failures with PGP are in part my fault for not correctly understanding what I was doing and part because of the horrendous UX of the gpg tools and the documentation that comes with it. A lot of tutorials, especially at the time, totally ommitted things like store a revocation certificate, store/backup your master key offline etc. while happily encouraging you to just push your key out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After spending a few hours every day of the week reading up on some resources around PGP and a number of tutorials around generating a good and secure key pairs I decided to give this one last try. If I can&#8217;t make it work this time, I&#8217;m done.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am taking a slightly different approach to PGP than usual, which resulted in the lovely <a href="https://twitter.com/hirojin">igalic</a> commenting on this by saying:</p>

<p>Contrary to what most people do my key only has one UID, without an associated e-mail address.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am me and the keypair that I&#8217;ve generated is supposed to be used to authenticate messages as coming from me or to encrypt content for my eyes only. My e-mail address doesn&#8217;t help to establish identity at all or that that message is in any way from me. That same key should be usable to authenticate/encrypt messages exchanges over Facebook, Twitter, e-mail or by telepathy. Not all of these are identifiable by an e-mail address.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to not run into the same trouble as before I decided that:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>My master key will be generated and stored on an encrypted USB drive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My master key will never be copied off that drive (though at times will be loaded into memeory if I have to sign another key).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My master key will only ever be able to certify other keys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My master key will expire in 5 years because I really hope that by then we have a better solution. If not I can always extend it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&#8217;ll have three separate subkeys, for authentication, encryption and signing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These three subkeys will be generated and stored on an OpenPGP Card compatible device and will never leave that device.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the device that generates and stores my subkeys I decided to go with a <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey-neo/">Yubikey NEO</a> that I happened to have. Besides OpenPGP it also supports FIDO U2F and can function as an OTP generator. If you had to buy one now I would suggest buying a <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey4/">Yubikey 4</a> instead as that one allows you to generate 4096 bit RSA subkeys, the NEO is limited to 2048.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a lot of content avaiable on how to do this and I&#8217;m not going to repeat it here. Read <a href="http://spin.atomicobject.com/2013/09/25/gpg-gnu-privacy-guard/">Mike English</a>'s excellent set of blogposts on the topic and <a href="https://www.esev.com/blog/post/2015-01-pgp-ssh-key-on-yubikey-neo/">this one by Eric Severance</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I adjusted them a bit to fit my needs in the sense that:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set up some <a href="https://github.com/daenney/gpg/blob/gh-pages/gpg.conf">sane settings</a> in <code>gpg.conf</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generated the master key myself (so not on the Yubikey) and stored directly on an encrypted USB drive (set <code>GNUPGHOME</code> environment variable to point to your desired location when generating it and don&#8217;t forget to copy a sane <code>gpg.conf</code> to that location too) .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generated a revocation key and distributed a few copies of it so that I can always revoke the key should it be compromised or if I lose access to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public key is stored on <a href="https://github.com/daenney/gpg">Github</a> and hosted through <a href="https://daenney.github.io/gpg/">Github Pages</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set <code>keyserver</code> on the Yubikey to point to the location of my key on the web and then imported it with a <code>fetch</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generated the subkeys on the device itself (<code>addcardkey</code>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It took me a lot of time in reading and trying this all out, combining different blogposts to reach the solution I deemed secure enough for my needs and still usable. I did this process a few times over and probably still fucked up somewhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The key with id 0x18D40820FA0EE03C is stored on <a href="https://github.com/daenney/gpg">Github</a> and leveraging Github Pages is available on <a href="https://daenney.github.io/gpg/" class="bare">https://daenney.github.io/gpg/</a>. It has also been pushed out to the GnuPG/sks-keyserver pool of servers. If you sign my key and push it back out do let me know (you really shouldn&#8217;t sign a key blindly anyway) so I can export it and update the copy on Github.</p>
