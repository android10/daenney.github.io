title:  "Out with the old, in with the new"
---

As some of you know, there's a big change coming over here. Because of
this I decided to throw out the old blog and the content that goes with
it, much like I'm throwing out most of my possessions in preparation of
what's to come. The idea is that'll blog about the new experiences,
perhaps sometimes even on a daily basis so that friends and family can
keep track of how everything's going.

I'm equal doses terrified and excited right now. Still a bunch of things
to do but my last day as a resident of
[country of The Netherlands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE\_IUPInEuc)
is almost upon me.
