= Work standing up and meditation
:published_at: 2015-02-18

As some of you know I practice Zen meditation. I generally sit in one of the Lotus positions but for a long time I wasn't able to hold that position for extended periods of time.

However, since I've switched to working standing up for about 3/4 of my day I've noticed a marked improvement in my capability to hold this pose. After just two weeks of doing this I can comfortably hold a pose for 15-20m whereas before at around 10-12m it would start to become unconfortable.

I can probably improve this even further once I actually join the yoga classes at work, which I've been promising myself to do for a while now. Last thing I need to figure out is a good quiet space at work to drop a zafu and meditate slightly more regularly during the day.
