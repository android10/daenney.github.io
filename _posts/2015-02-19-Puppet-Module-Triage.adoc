= Puppet Module Triage
:hp-tags: puppetlabs, modules, apt, nodejs, hulk smash, triage

Today we had our usual Puppet Module triage. It's a time a week where module contributors and the Puppetlabs Module Team gather online to discuss, comment, merge or reject PR's against the different module. This is the best time for you as a contributor to join if you have a PR pending and want feedback.

For the first time we've kept minutes of the meeting, what we did and why and you can read up on them https://github.com/puppet-community/community-triage/blob/master/modules/notes/2015-02-19.md[here]. The Puppet Core Team also keeps their minutes in the same repository: https://github.com/puppet-community/community-triage[puppet-community/community-triage] so feel free to read up on those too.

Two major things happend:

* https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apt/pull/424[hulk_smash] got merged into https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apt/tree/next[apt/next]
* a huge rework/refactor PR on https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-nodejs/pull/103#issuecomment-75107863[nodejs] landed
