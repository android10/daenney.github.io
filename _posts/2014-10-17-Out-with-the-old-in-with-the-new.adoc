= Out with the old, in with the new
:published_at: 2014-10-17


As some of you know, there's a big change coming over here. Because of this I decided to throw out the old blog and the content that goes with it, much like I'm throwing out most of my possessions in preparation of what's to come. The idea is that'll blog about the new experiences, perhaps sometimes even on a daily basis so that friends and family can keep track of how everything's going.

I'm equal doses terrified and excited right now. Still a bunch of things to do but my last day as a resident of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE_IUPInEuc[the country of The Netherlands] is almost upon me.
