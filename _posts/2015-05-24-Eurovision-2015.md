Last night
[Europe went to war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest).
No the Germans didn't start it, we were just having a huge music
contest followed by some political voting to decide who should win.

I adore the [Eurovision Song Contest](http://www.eurovision.tv/page/timeline)
It might not be a manly thing to admit to but it's one of
those things that just gets me ridiculously, over the rainbow to the
moon, happy. It's also been a fairly progressive contest with LGBTQ
members participating and people in drag aren't unfamiliar to the
Eurovision either.

This year Austria hosted it in their beautiful capital of Vienna after
the most fabulous bearded lady in history,
[Conchita Wurst](http://conchitawurst.com), took home the trophy. In a
206 point victory her [Rise like a phoenix](http://youtu.be/QRUIava4WRM),
which ought to be the theme to the next Bond movie, is one of
the most popular acts in Eurovision history.

I'm pretty sure [I cried](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OxVSeAgIw0)
last year, together with the rest of the LGBTQ community and our
friends. Even more so after the crap one of the contestants, looking at
you Mother Russia, has been pulling with their anti-gay propaganda laws
setting back LGBTQ rights in Russia to almost the pre-WWII era. They
even tried to get Conchita barred from participating and threatned to
pull out if she would. No tears would've been shed if they had.

Yesterday [Conchita returned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_JH9DO1wn0),
gorgeous as ever, rocking those heels like many a woman
wishes she could, with a waistline Marie-Antoinette would be jealous of.

The most remarkable thing of this year though was the battle going on
between Russia and Sweden. The Russian entry was genuinely good and one
of the better acts this year which got a lot of us nervous. As much as
we want to support the artist we can't support the country. What would a
Eurovision hosted in Russia even look like?

To be frank, Eurovision is one of the gayest events in Europe, safe for
the Pride parades and you just can't be gay in Russia right now. Even
worse, as the country hosting it, how much control would they get over
the ESF preventing certain candidates from participating based on their
gender or sexual identity? And if they would try to pull one over, what
would the ESF do? I'm not sure any of us is ready to face that question
just yet.

Thankfully once most of Eastern Europe was done cozying up to Russia,
Sweden quickly closed the gap and took the lead. Though most Western
European countries gave Russia some points, it really was a good act,
Sweden eventually got enough of a lead that before everyone was done
voting they, we, won.

Next year the Eurovision is coming to Sweden once more, the home of ABBA
and the [Singing Sailor Defence System](http://www.svenskafreds.se/singingsailor).
I'll be right there in the crowd with so many others.
