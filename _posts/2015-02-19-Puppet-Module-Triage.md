Today we had our usual Puppet Module triage. It's a time a week where
module contributors and the Puppetlabs Module Team gather online to
discuss, comment, merge or reject PR's against the different module.
This is the best time for you as a contributor to join if you have a PR
pending and want feedback.

For the first time we've kept minutes of the meeting, what we did and
why and you can read up on them
[here](https://github.com/puppet-community/community-triage/blob/master/modules/notes/2015-02-19.md).
The Puppet Core Team also keeps their minutes in the same repository:
[puppet-community/community-triage](https://github.com/puppet-community/community-triage)
so feel free to read up on those too.

Two major things happened:

-   [hulk smash](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apt/pull/424)
    got merged into
    [apt/next](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apt/tree/next)
-   a huge rework/refactor PR on
    [nodejs](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-nodejs/pull/103#issuecomment-75107863)
    landed
